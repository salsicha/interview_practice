# Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]

# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []

# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz


head = [1,2,3,4,5]
n = 2

head.pop(-2)

print(head)

# There is a defective lighthouse located at a position α along the shore and 
# a distance β out to sea (see figure above). The lighthouse emits highly 
# collimated ﬂashes at random times and at random azimuths 
# (a good lighthouse emits ﬂashes at regular intervals, 
# usually due to rotation of the lighthouse beam). A dense array of photodetectors 
# is set up along the shore and each ﬂash is recorded by a single photodetector. 
# The data consist of the position xk of the illuminated photodector for the kth flash. 
# Consider the case where neither α nor β are known beforehand. 
# Calculate the distributions of the logarithm of the posterior probability 
# for a grid of α and β values. Then plot the 2-dimensional distribution of 
# the posterior distribution as a contour plot in the α-β plane.
